### What is hangman? 
Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

### How to play
- The hangman should consist of a head, a body, 2 arms, and 2 legs.
- You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. ...
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
